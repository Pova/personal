I started working on basic website design while lecturing at UCSD. At the time I was simply creating a basic website for storing useful information and content for the students. Over time this grew into a place to implement some math visualization projects relevant to the calculus classes I was lecturing at the time:

- curves in space
- vector fields
- differential equations

The current version of my website has updates to these projects (cleaner aesthetics, more interactive).

I have a passion for sharing knowledge and communicating ideas effectively. Because of this I wanted my website to be the following: 

- attractive to look at - engage the eye of the user to gain their attention
- interesting abstractly - representi an algorithm or concept worth thinking about 
- interactive - users are more interested in things fun to play around with

Recently I've decided to change careers away from mathematics and education and into the world of computer science: programming, data science and machine learning. 

As part of this journey I have put together this website and have been implementing various projects in javascript to demonstrate my progress. I have many ideas for upcoming visualization projects and will be continuing to update the website as these are completed. *If you have any ideas you'd like to suggest please let me know*.
