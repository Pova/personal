I started working on basic website design while lecturing at UCSD. At the time I was simply creating a basic website for storing useful information and content for the students. Over time this grew into a place to implement some math visualization projects relevant to the calculus classes I was lecturing at the time:

- <b>curves in space</b>
- <b>vector fields</b>
- <b>differential equations</b>

The current version of my website has updates to these projects (cleaner aesthetics, more interactive).

I have a passion for sharing knowledge and communicating ideas effectively. Because of this I wanted my website to be the following: 

- <b>attractive to look at</b> - _engage the eye of the user to gain their attention_
- <b>interesting abstractly</b> - _representing an algorithm or concept worth thinking about_ 
- <b>interactive</b> - _users are more interested in things fun to play around with_

Recently I've decided to change careers from mathematics and education into the world of computer science: programming, data science and machine learning. 

As part of this journey I have put together this website and have been implementing various projects in javascript to demonstrate my progress. I have many ideas for upcoming visualization projects and will be continuing to update the website as these are completed. *If you have any ideas you'd like to suggest please let me know*.
