# This is the repository for my personal website

<hr>

I started working on basic website design while lecturing at UCSD. At the time I was simply creating a basic website for storing useful information and content for the students. Over time this grew into a place to implement some math visualization projects relevant to the calculus classes I was lecturing at the time:

- curves in space
- vector fields
- differential equations

This current version represents an updated version of some of those projects and an opportunity to experiment with interactive web-based visualizations.
